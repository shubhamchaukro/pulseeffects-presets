# pulseeffects-presets
A set of presets that can be imported directly into the Pulse Effects App which fixes the audio quality issue in Linux Distributions.

The Clearboost patches are for reqular viewing like Videos, Moviesm Calls etc. and are all optimised for a slightly different experience

The Reverb patches are what I use for listening to music and they give a listening experience far far richer than even Windows with all it's proprietary drivers and team of developers!
